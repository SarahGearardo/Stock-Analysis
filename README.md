# Stock-Analysis
Analyzing stock data

##Project Overview</br>
The original purpose of this project was to analyze the DQ stock for our friend Steve's parents. They were interested in investing in this particular stock and wanted to make sure that they would get the most out of their money. When we analized the DQ stock, it was found that the return rate was poor for their overall volume. Due to that, we decided to focus on reviewing the rate of return for 2017 and 2018 to see which stocks have the best return rate and hopefully give that information to Steve's parents to make a better decision on which stock to pick. After we were done coding the spreadsheet and making a button for ease of use, the data was refractoroed to make it run a little faster.<br>
