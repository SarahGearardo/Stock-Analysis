# Stock-Analysis

## Project Overview</br>
The original purpose of this project was to analyze the DQ stock for our friend Steve's parents. They were interested in investing in this particular stock and wanted to make sure that they would get the most out of their money. When we analized the DQ stock, it was found that the return rate was poor for their overall volume. Due to that, we decided to focus on reviewing the rate of return for 2017 and 2018 to see which stocks have the best return rate and hopefully give that information to Steve's parents to make a better decision on which stock to pick. After we were done coding the spreadsheet and making a button for ease of use, the data was refractoroed to make it run a little faster.</br>

## Summary</br>
### Advantages and Disadvantages in Refractoring</br>
I believe the advantages of refractoring are easy to sell, which is that refratoring your code can help it run faster. This might be useful if you are working with a lot of data at once and I can see how it could easily shave minutes off of the time it takes to run your script to get the data you need. I think with this dataset we were given, though, the time we saved was mere seconds and it took a lot of trial and error to get this to run. Another advantage as well as disadvantage to refratoring your own code is that you are familiar with it, so sometimes the changes you need to make aren't always going to be obvious to you if you have been working on it for a long time, however, the same can be said for knowing your own code inside and out. If I was to refractor someone elses code without building it myself first, I can see how it could take longer because I would need to get familiar with how they "speak".</br>

### Advantages and Disadvantages on the Refractored VBA Script</br>
The biggest advantage I found with working with the refractored script is that there was less text to work with. I felt like the original script we built to get the analysis for the DQ stocks, which eventually led us to analyzing all stocks was getting a bit combourome. One disadvantage I found with refractoring this VBA script was having to have two modules open for differet sets of code. If you aren't paying attention, I can understand how it could be confusing on which module you are working with. There were times I thought I was running code with my refractored modle, but it turned out to be the original code because I was not paying close enough attention. This could lead to mistakes if people don't catch themselves.
